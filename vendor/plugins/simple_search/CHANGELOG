== SVN
* A multitude of small reorganization in an attempt to make this work again

* Wrapping search term binding addition in begin/rescue so that no duplicates are inserted

* Started on Ferret fixes

* And fixed it for PostgreSQL

* Fixed inclusive searching with TermIndexer when searching for more than one term

* Fixed a bug in boolean keyword stripping (thx Ben Curtis)

* TermIndexer: fixed the situation where the indexer might start searching for an empty set.
  This was not critical for SQLite and MySQL but critical for Postgres

* Implemented conditional indexing

* Ferret concurrency issues magically resolved with Ferret updates

* Modified index_repr to return empty strings for Nils

* Added Ferret support

* Added bailing when unknown option keys are supplied

* Indexers can be told to wipe indexes by using Indexer#prune!

* Indexers will use "index_repr_of_attribute" if it's present

* Attributes used for indexing are now excluded from indexing, and global indexers() collection
  can be addressed by class or str

* Added :using option to +indexes_columns+ so that a special indexer can be passed

* Added edge rails to testing libraries if edge rails are available in the app

* Fixed a very odd issue of model classes becoming corrupted after the dependencies were reloaded,
  we now store the name of the model constant and retrieve it dynamically.
  Don't know how to test it though.

* Changed RIGHT JOIN to LEFT JOIN because in this context
  it's still applicable and sqlite3 doesn't support RIGHT JOIN. Note that OCI 8
  supports neither one of the two, but we're not targeting the enterprise market
  
* Added more tests for index cleanup and updates
