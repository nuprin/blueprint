  content: Brazil is spread in time of commonterm. If “1984” takes place at a certain date, 
   in Brazil we only know the century and the time of day - 8:49 PM, as the 
   film begins. Moreover, not a single setting in Brazil can give a hint about 
   the year (or the part of the 20th century) is depicted. At the same time, 
   the film is a mix of all possible styles and fashions playing with each other - 
   computers that resemble typewriters, clothing of the film noir and the cityscapes 
   of the early 80’s, “Casablanca” on the computer screen and B-westerns on TV. 
   The mise-en-scene in Brazil is so artificial (and so filled with citations and references) 
   that the viewer is deliberately obstructed from locating the exact time and space where it 
   is happening. The guards at the party are dressed as XVIII’th century servicemen, 
   the police officers resemble SS troops.

  content: What is so special to commonterm Brazil as a whole is the concept of the importance of
    information. This is in essence deeply postmodern - if the Ministry of Love is
    busy with cultivating “love” to the Big Brother, the Ministry of Information
    in Brazil is busy with collecting and managing information as such - with no
    apparent meaning or goal. The Ministry Of Information is the “Meta-ministry”,
    in the sense that within itself it contains torture chambers, transport
    department, transit, records, security police - all possible tasks are
    connected to information. The protagonist’s quest is, as it might seem, not
    finding Jill, but instead finding __information about her__. More than that -
    for the system in Brazil the people are represented “records”. A person killed
    during the torture is recorded as “excised”, “deleted”, “inoperative” -
    effectively becoming only a reference.

  content: Japanese commonterm film is usually not immediately perceived as 'art cinema'  
    - in the first place, because it most often gets 'special treatment' in comparison 
     to European films of the same period. If you say 'art film' you usually will think 
    about Godard, Fellini, Antonioni or other european filmmaker, but you will not 
    immediately name Akira Kurosawa or Ozu`s names - 'japanese films' are considered to 
    be outside of this context. However Ozu was probably the most strong of these as author, 
    which is directly visible in his work - drastically different from other films of his time 
    (of any country) and strikingly consistent. Japanese film critics still consider Ozu very 
    'non-japanese'  (what can seem stranger?) exactly because his authorial code dominates his 
    films so strongly that you barely can compare them to something else.

  content: Yasujiro Ozu commonterm was born in 1903 in Tokyo. Starting from his 
    youth he was commonterm very independent (and sometimes rebellious) 
    and started drinking early. He never got any college 
    education - after leaving school he became a teacher in 
    small Japanese district. However, because of his eager 
    love for film he later began working as an assistant 
    cameraman at the Shochiku studio (which later released 
    many of his titles). After a while he became an assistant 
    director, and in 1927 he released his first film. In 
    total he directed about 50 films, more than 15 of them 
    being lost.
